# Theater as Data

This repository contains code and data for the projects described in my book _Theater as Data_(University of Michigan Press, 2021), which is available [here](https://press.umich.edu/Books/T/Theater-as-Data2) as Open Access. The book explains how and when to use computational methods for studying the performing arts (and other forms of intangible cultural heritage). 

## 2024 Update

The code here is almost identical to that which is available from the publisher's website, with some minor adaptations for easier work with the most recent version of certain libraries.

## Installation

You can clone this repository to run this code locally. You can installed the required packages with the following command

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Alternatively, you can also run the four Notebooks directly on Google colab:
- [Words](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Y3yQwFKqjQemTeelmMsJiwgc1qDzoG6v?usp=sharing) (Chapter 4)
- [Networks](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11zpXNz7ooWBfYCvcex8NKQcce8I8NnGh?usp=sharing) (Chapter 5)
- [Motion](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1v_Xe3td6L0WaBVdeBW0M4qlE176RJfuk?usp=sharing)(Chapter 6)
- [Location](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1anY9UGVpc3C2riqhXfXa_tDL5LX6uQ_r?usp=sharing)(Chapter 7)

***Note**: the code in Colab has been adapted slightly to load the data directly from this GitHub repo, rather than having to upload it directly.

## Notes on Python and Jupyter

This interactive Jupyter Notebooks assume basic familiarity with Python and Jupyter. For users not familiar with Python, I recommend Allen Downey's [Elements of Data Science](https://allendowney.github.io/ElementsOfDataScience/) and Melanie Walsh's [Introduction to Cultural Analytics & Python](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/welcome.html)
